# .geetinclude
#
# This file defines the POSITIVE set of files and directories that belong to
# this template layer.
#
# Think of this as answering:
#   "Which parts of this project should be shared with other apps
#    that use this template?"
#
# IMPORTANT:
# - This is a WHITELIST, not a .gitignore.
# - Only paths listed here will be visible to the template git repo.
# - Everything else in the working tree is treated as app-specific.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# SYNTAX
#
# - One path per line
# - Paths are relative to the project root
# - Blank lines are ignored
# - Lines starting with '#' are comments
# - Do NOT prefix paths with '!'
#
# Globs are allowed (same syntax as .gitignore):
#   **  matches any number of directories
#   *   matches within a single path segment
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EXAMPLES
#
# Share an entire directory:
#   app/**
#
# Share a subtree:
#   src/shared/**
#
# Share a single file:
#   package.json
#
# Share multiple specific config files:
#   app.json
#   app.config.ts
#   tsconfig.json
#
